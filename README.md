# üèôÔ∏è New York City Property Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 100,000 residential property transactions across New York City to predict real estate sale prices using machine learning. By uncovering the key drivers of property value, the model helps stakeholders‚Äîsuch as real estate professionals, investors, and city planners‚Äîmake more informed pricing, investment, and planning decisions. The final stacked model accurately predicts sale prices, offering valuable insight into one of the most complex real estate markets in the world.

**Research Question:**  
Can NYC property sale prices be accurately predicted from publicly available data?

## Methodology
- Trained 10 supervised machine learning models to predict property sale prices
- Final stacked model combined Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost

## Key Findings
- A stacked regression model (Random Forest + XGBoost + Linear Regression) outperformed baseline models.
     - **R-squared:** 0.74
- Feature importance analysis showed location-based variables (borough and neighborhood) were among the top drivers of sale price.


## Technologies Used
- Python  
- scikit-learn
